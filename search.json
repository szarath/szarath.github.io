ACHIEVEMENTS High school I have received a meritorious mention for my academic excellence twice in consecutive years from 2012 to 2013. As well as other awards for my participation and involvement in chess ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------- Undergraduate Projects 2nd year Project This was an eCommerce site to sell tech hardware. It made use of Vb/Asp.net, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MS SQL for database handling. 3rd year Project This was a web project that was a classified site to sell secondhand goods. Made use of C#/Asp.net, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for the front-end. The back-end consisted of WCF which had SOAP protocol service reference for Website and the mobile made use of the REST protocol. I worked on the complete back-end as well as the full mobile solution. The mobile solution communicated to the WCF with URL requests and the WCF responded with JSON data of the retrieved from the MS SQL database. The WCF also made use of custom behaviors, Endpoint and data contracts. ","------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------- Honors Projects 1) Service computing project: A game a simple C# desktop application that made use of my own web- services with WCF consisting of MS SQL for database and made use of custom behaviors and endpoint to help secure the channel of communication from client to back-end 2) Mobile Programming: A Gaming stats recorder made in native Android (Java) and the data was stored in the back-end which was communicated via REST implemented in a WCF with MS SQL. 3) Final Honors project A social networking collaborative system for Software Developers that can assist them with posting open source projects and inviting members to the project. The system also helps the user manage any issues that may arise and provide them with the capability to pick the members of the team that the issues are handed to. The solution is made using C#/Asp.net, HTML, CSS, Google API and the back-end was hosted on WCF which contained MS SQL database and made use of custom behaviors to help with the transmission of large files. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------- Before I started my undergrad in BSc IT. I was developing a blog on WordPress using PHP, I had developed my own add-ons for the KODI media application in python and I made a hosted media viewing web page using HTML and CSS.

In addition to these tasks, I developed and published two native Android mobile applications on the Google ","Play Store: To-Do App: A productivity tool designed for task management and organization. Simulation Game: An engaging and interactive simulation-based mobile game. The links to the apps are as follows: To-Do App: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ets.todo Simulation Game: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ets.live The frameworks, tools, and technologies used included Native Android, Java, Kotlin .NET Framework, .NET Core 5, Entity Core, C#, Azure, Azure DevOps, Design Patterns, Postman, SyncFusion, Angular, YAML, MSSQL, DDD, SOLID Principles, RESTful Services, Git, Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code Consulting-Software Engineer Oct 2022 - Mar 2023 IQ Business Client: Investec I worked on micro-services systems that cater to the private bank sector. This work was in a team that consisted of other skilled individuals that supported and maintained as well as created new systems that assisted the overall experience for the end user. My most accomplished achievement for the role was a creation of a new back-end API that was hosted on Azure for a new product. I began by going thru existing solutions and tracing their flow in the architecture/ecosystem and manipulated the data that was sent. The API was consumed and integrated without disrupting the existing flow of the client and consultant view to display the product information as well as keep all the functionality of the sites consistent regardless of product selection. The framework, tools, and technologies used here included, .net Framework, .net core 3.1 - 7, Entity core, C#, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, Azure DevOps, Design patterns, Post-man, Mono-repo, Angular, React, Bicep, Terraform, YAML, MSSQL, DDD, SOLID principles, Restful services, Git, Visual Studio and Visual code Software Development Engineer July 2021 - Aug 2022 Amecor I started by developing the company's API and from there ventured into other parts of the company's system.

Git was used in assisting with version control of the development of various projects. This was a team of a developer collaborating and working individually and remotely in conjunction with the hardware team on internal and external applications. My most accomplished achievement was when I created and implemented a device tracking algorithm by manipulating and modifying existing legacy micro-services and also updating the customer portal to display the device location. This functionality helped visually present the logged information as well as calculate based on set criteria the device location accuracy and help mitigate the loss of devices and revenue. The tech stack I used at this company was .Net framework, .Net core, MVC, Entity, JavaScript, LINQ, Angular, SQL, Postman, Git, MS SQL, and Azure DevOps.
