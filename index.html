It made use of Vb/Asp.net, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MS SQL for database handling. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>3rd year Project</div><div>This was a web project that was a classified site to sell secondhand goods. Made use of C#/Asp.net, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for the front-end. The back-end consisted of WCF which had SOAP protocol service reference for Website and the mobile made use of the REST protocol. I worked on the complete back-end as well as the full mobile solution. The mobile solution communicated to the WCF with URL requests and the WCF responded with JSON data of the retrieved from the MS SQL database. The WCF also made use of custom behaviors, Endpoint and data contracts. <br /></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br /></div><div>Honors Projects <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>1) Service computing project: A game  a simple C# desktop application that made use of my own web-services with WCF consisting of  MS SQL for database and made use of custom behaviors and endpoint to help secure the channel of communication from client to back-end<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>2) Mobile Programming: A Gaming stats recorder made in native Android (Java) and the data was stored in the back-end which was communicated via REST implemented in a WCF with MS SQL. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>3) Final Honors project</div><div>A social networking collaborative system for Software Developers that can assist them with posting open source projects and inviting members to the project. The system also helps the user manage any issues that may arise and provide them with the capability to pick the members of the team that the issues are handed to. The solution is made using C#/Asp.net, HTML, CSS, Google API and the back-end was hosted on WCF which contained MS SQL database and made use of custom behaviors to help with the transmission of large files. </div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br /></div><div>Before I started my undergrad in BSc IT. I was developing a blog on WordPress using PHP, I had developed my own add-ons for the KODI media application in python and I made a hosted media viewing web page using HTML and CSS. As well as a slew of development using Ubuntu and Linux from making homemade cloud solutions to media centers. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.</div><div><br /></div><div>In 2022 I was awarded 7th place by myjobmag.co.za for the advice I gave to students and other like minded individuals that are aspiring to be software engineers. <br /></div></span>

I worked on research projects in the company in terms of Analytics and new features/proof of concepts apart from the day-to-day overall support for the system.<br /><br />This was a key role and as such, I had to quickly understand the company's business rules as well as how the company processes its data from its end users. This was achieved by looking at the company's database learning how the table relations work also learning from the management about the vision of the company. I had to also work with the hardware and what data is being received. We made use of Azure DevOps to handle work items and future iterations/features. Git was used in assisting with version control of the development of various projects. This was a team of a developer collaborating and working individually and remotely in conjunction with the hardware team on internal and external applications.<br /><br />My most accomplished achievement was when I created and implemented a device tracking algorithm by manipulating and modifying existing legacy micro-services and also updating the customer portal to display the device location. This functionality helped visually present the logged information as well as calculate based on set criteria the device location accuracy and help mitigate the loss of devices and revenue. <br /><br />The tech stack I used at this company was .Net framework, .Net core, MVC, Entity, JavaScript, LINQ, Angular, SQL, Postman, Git, MS SQL, and Azure DevOps.</div></div></div><div class="clear"> </div>
